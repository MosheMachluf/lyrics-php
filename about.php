        The "Lyrics" website was founded in 2020 with the aim of letting talented songwriters present and share
        their works to other writters in order to inspire or singers who would be interested in collaborations.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        The idea for this project came up to give the stage to talented people especially to those at the
        beginning of their journey but not only, also veteran and well-known creators take advantage of our
        platform for all sorts of interesting collaborations that make music diverse.
